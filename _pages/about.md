## Me, myself, and I

### My interests

#### Programming
I have been programming since 2010 when I was first introduced to C# during my time in gymnasium. I have since then developed a variety of applications including, but not limited to (all of those are written in C# [I assume that will change soon]):
* Quality of life improvements
  * Spotify-plugin
  * Encrypt/decrypt solutions
  * Alternative script language (named RavenScripts; capable of executing for instance update procedures for my own applications etc.)
  * Chat bots (for Twitch using their API)
  * Managers (for Tumblr, Twitch, & Patreon using their respective APIs)
* Games
  * 2D Platformers
  * Top-down shooters
* Text processors
  * Parsers (basic html, JSON, & .ini files)

  #### 3D
I work with 3D as a hobby using mainly the application [3ds Max](https://www.autodesk.eu/products/3ds-max/overview).

_Note: This is a really old image and is far from 'my best work'. It was just the most convenient example I had at hand when making this._
