# About me
### Who I am
I am an absolute nobody. I go by the student name ja222ts or the alias Nidawi. I am a textbook nerd and enjoy all nerd-appropriate things such as coding, video games, computers in general, 3D design, and hitting the gym. I guess the last part doesn't really fit. I've never liked writing "about me" pages because there's quite literally nothing to know about me. I hope that I will one day become a developer of some description (preferably developing software that is helpful in some way) and I'd like to make a 3D game one day. That's about it, really.
#### Programming
I have been programming since 2010 when I was first introduced to C# during my time in gymnasium (gymnasium is an acceptable word in English now!). I have since then developed a variety of applications including, but not limited to (all of those are written in C# [I assume that will change soon]):
* Quality of life improvements
  * Spotify-plugin
  * Encrypt/decrypt solutions
  * Alternative script language (named RavenScripts; capable of executing for instance update procedures for my own applications etc.)
  * Chat bots (for Twitch using their API)
  * Managers (for Tumblr, Twitch, & Patreon using their respective APIs)
* Games
  * 2D Platformers
  * Top-down shooters
* Text processors
  * Parsers (basic html, JSON, & .ini files)  

#### 3D design
I work with 3D as a hobby using mainly the application [3ds Max](https://www.autodesk.eu/products/3ds-max/overview). I create mostly "fan art" images and animations based on the game *World of Warcraft* using various assets taken from the actual game files. I do also, however, model, texture, and rig a fair bit myself and have created a few semi-complex character models with proper textures and rigging.

#### Some examples of my work
It should be noted that all of these examples are quite old and not accurate representations of where I am right now. Not that there's been much of a change but still.
