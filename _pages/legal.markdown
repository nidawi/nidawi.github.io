A few notices about what went into creating this site.

#### Pixabay
*Most, if not all, of the images used on this site were provided free-of-charge by the generous people over at [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). "What is Pixabay?" you ask. Well, I'll tell you: "Pixabay is a vibrant community of creatives, sharing copyright free images and videos. All contents are released under Creative Commons CC0, which makes them safe to use without asking for permission or giving credit to the artist - even for commercial purposes." (taken from their [FAQ](https://pixabay.com/en/service/faq/))*
#### Various sources
*There was a lot of googling involved in making this CSS stuff come true. Thanks to all the wonderful people over at [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)! I have loved you all ever since 2010 and I ain't stopping any time soon.*
