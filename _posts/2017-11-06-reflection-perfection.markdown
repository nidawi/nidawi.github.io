### What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
Compare to regular CSS
Which techniques did you use?
Pros and cons?

### What do you think of static site generators?
I feel that they could be useful for smaller scale sites that don't rely on complex design routines or advanced features. For those who prioritize their sites being quick and relatively easy to set up and maintain.  
Something that bothers me is that I cannot make the list with blog posts look decent and javascript seems to be completely out of the question.

### What type of projects are they suitable for?
What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

### What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

### How did you implements comments to blog posts

### What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?
